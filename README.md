# ArithmaGenie
ArithmaGenie is a REPL-based arbitrary-precision calculator built entirely from scratch. It performs calculations on massive numbers without relying on native large-number support or external libraries. With a clean interface and extensible design, ArithmaGenie is both powerful and fun to use.

Features:
.Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with remainder), and modulo operations on extremely large numbers.
.Advanced Math Operations: Includes factorials and exponentiation.
.Interactive REPL Interface: Input commands directly and see real-time results.
.Extensible Design: Easily add features like logarithms, base conversions, or fractions

Run the REPL calculator and start entering commands. 
Examples:
. add 1234 5678
  

.subtract 2023 1987


.multiply 1234 5678


.divide 2023 2

.factorial 20

Supported Commands:

.add <num1> <num2>	Adds two numbers.
.subtract <num1> <num2>	Subtracts the second number from the first.
.multiply <num1> <num2>	Multiplies two numbers.
.divide <num1> <num2>	Divides the first number by the second, returning the quotient and remainder.
.factorial <num>	Computes the factorial of a number.

Getting Started:
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Installation:
